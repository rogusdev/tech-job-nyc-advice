Learn the concepts of programming to start:
* functions and variables
* input and output
* storing + retrieving data
* external requests
* sync vs async/threads

i.e. have some of the core concepts in mind before digging in.

Then some online javascript or python training website / videos, there are plenty within googling reach

Followed quickly by practice programming puzzles in edabit, codewars, or leetcode/hackerrank (I prefer the former two)
